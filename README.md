# Pattern-Sense-Classifying-Fabric-Patterns-using-Deep-Learning


Pattern Sense is a deep learning-based project that classifies fabric patterns into different categories: Checks, Dotted, Floral, Plain, and Striped. The goal is to automate the process of fabric pattern recognition, which can be useful in the fashion and textile industries. We built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a labeled dataset of fabric images and deployed it through a simple web application where users can upload images and get instant predictions.
